## 1. Recency Frequency Monetary Analysis  
Process an anonymous UK Retailer dataset from Kagle to understand customer segmentation, based on the well-known RFM framework.
In RFM, 'R' stands for 'Recency' which represents the difference of last purchased date and a predefined date; 'F' stands for 'Frequency'
which describes the amount of transactions that has been conducted by a customer on a specific period; lastly, while 'M' tells the amount
of financial transactions for a specific user in a specific period. After completion, we will understood who are our 'Best Customers', 
'Loyal Customers', and even 'Almost Lost', 'Lost', and 'Lost Cheap Customers'.

## 2. Directing Customer Subscription Model
The goal of the project is to be able to predict which customer will subscribe to the premium feature after 48 hours. The approach is to use
a Logistic Regression, since we are faced with a binary classification problem. The model yields an accuracy of 0.767 (+/- 0.013). 
Accuracy is the sum of True Positive and True Negative over the sum of total amount of predicted data.
